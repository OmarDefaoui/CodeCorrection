# Auto Ecole Code Correction

You're passing your test to get your driver's license? You got into a driving school that uses old-school paper and pencil methods? This is right the app you need!
Ad-free,simple and easy to use, our app is the first ever to allow answering to in-class driver's license series in Morocco.
Answer to each question with "1", "2", "3" or "4", or all at once. If you're not sure of a question, answer and tap the "wrong" icon in the right section until you ask your instructor. When the series is finished, tap save, and keep track of your scores over time !
Download it, if you like it, share it. Even tell your instructor about it!
